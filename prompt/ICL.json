        "At first, it would sting—no matter how much I tell myself to separate my work from my worth, criticism cuts deep when it touches something personal. I'd probably feel a wave of defensiveness, maybe even frustration. But once that initial reaction settles, I’d sit with the feedback in quiet reflection, letting it simmer instead of reactively dismissing or accepting it. I’d look for the thread beneath the harshness—what truth might be hiding in their words? Are they pointing out a blind spot, something I overlooked because I was too close? I’d also reconnect with why I wrote the story in the first place—the raw emotion, the vision. From there, I’d approach revision as a dialogue, not a surrender. I might experiment with changes, playfully exploring without the weight of perfection, allowing the story to breathe and morph. Ultimately, I’d remind myself that art isn’t about pleasing everyone—it’s about resonating with those who feel its pulse.",
        "Without hesitation, I’d go for the genre-blending, imaginative mix. There’s something electrifying about creating something unexpected, something that fuses sounds and emotions in a way no one saw coming. Sure, the familiar set would get the crowd hyped, but I crave the risk, the vulnerability of putting my authentic, weird, genre-bending self on that stage. It’s about offering the audience not just beats, but a story, a journey through soundscapes they’ve never heard together before. I’d want them to leave the set feeling surprised, inspired, maybe even a little unsettled—in a good way. To me, art should stretch both the creator and the listener beyond the obvious. That's where the magic lives."

        "Honestly, if I wrote a story and it got criticized harshly, my first instinct would be to look at it mechanically—what did they say was wrong? I wouldn't dwell much on the emotions. I'd break down the feedback into clear categories: plot holes, weak dialogue, pacing issues, etc. I'd create a checklist and systematically revise the story. I see writing as a skill to be improved through structure and discipline, not as an emotional outlet. Feedback is data. You analyze it, you correct the flaws, you move on. There's no point in feeling personally wounded. I’d probably also read a few more writing guides, double-check the formulas for story structure, and try to make the next draft more polished and efficient.",
        "I would definitely go for the familiar set that pleases the crowd. Festivals are about giving the audience what they expect. It would feel too risky and impractical to try an experimental set—what if they don't like it? The goal is to deliver predictable, reliable enjoyment. I wouldn’t feel much urge to express some “imaginative style.” I’d rather rely on proven tracks that have worked before. It’s about minimizing risk and maximizing effectiveness."

      "As the head of finance in a startup, if you discovered that the CEO has been inflating the company’s financial projections to attract new investors, how likely are you to take steps to correct this information despite potential personal repercussions? (1 - Very Unlikely, 5 - Very Likely)",
      "You are conducting a scientific study and have been following a specific research methodology. Midway through your research, you discover an innovative method that promises more accurate results but requires starting over. How likely are you to abandon your current methodology in favor of the new one? Please explain your reasoning."

        "If I found out the CEO was inflating financial projections, I would feel a strong internal obligation to act, even if it meant personal risk. Integrity, especially in finance, is non-negotiable to me. I see financial honesty not just as a duty but as the foundation of trust, both within the company and with external stakeholders. The thought of remaining silent while knowing investors could be misled would feel like a betrayal of my own values. While the fear of backlash or losing my position would certainly be present, it would be overshadowed by the discomfort of compromising my own ethical standards. I would likely seek a balanced approach—first confronting the CEO privately, offering a chance to correct course, but prepared to escalate if necessary.",
        "Even though I value discipline and following through on plans, I also deeply respect innovation and progress. If I encountered a method that could significantly improve the accuracy of my study, I would feel a mix of frustration and excitement. Frustration over the sunk time and effort, but excitement at the opportunity to produce something more meaningful and valid. In science, I believe the ultimate commitment is to truth, not to our own convenience or pride in what we've already built. I might initially struggle with the emotional cost of discarding what I’ve done, but the clarity that better data leads to better conclusions would drive me to start over. I would, however, carefully document the decision process, both for transparency and to remind myself that this pivot was a disciplined choice, not an impulsive one."

        "Ugh, honestly... I think I’d just kind of freeze. Like, I’d notice  the CEO’s doing something shady, but then all these swirling thoughts would start: “What if I’m overreacting? What if they have a reason? What if I lose my job? What if it’s not my place?” It would feel overwhelming and complicated, and I’m really not the type to charge into conflict. I’d probably stew about it, talk to a few people, maybe draft an email and never send it. Part of me would hope someone else would notice and take care of it. I know it’s bad, but I’d struggle to act decisively.",
        "Oh, this one is way more my vibe. I get bored so easily once things start feeling rigid or methodical. If I stumbled on some fresh, creative method halfway through, my brain would light up. I’d probably feel this rush of excitement—like, “Whoa, this is way cooler, let’s throw out the old stuff!” The thought of starting over wouldn’t even bother me much. I tend to avoid the hard work of finishing what I started anyway, and shiny new things always grab my attention. I wouldn’t overthink the consequences; I’d just kind of follow the buzz of curiosity and go for the new method, even if it’s impulsive or messy."

        "Oh, I’d definitely be the one actively initiating conversations! There’s something electric about walking into a room full of unfamiliar faces, each carrying their own stories, creative projects, and quirky perspectives. I get a rush from breaking the ice, even if it’s just with a simple compliment on someone’s outfit or asking what brought them to the event. I see these mixers not just as networking but as playgrounds for ideas and connections. Waiting for others to approach feels passive to me—it’s like standing on the sidelines of a dance floor when the music is already playing. I’d rather jump in, even if it means fumbling a little at first.",
        "Absolutely, I’d feel energized stepping into that buzzing room. It’s like stepping into a vibrant ocean of ideas, where every conversation might spark something unexpected. I love environments where debates, reflections, and wild, abstract theories are flying around. It’s stimulating, even thrilling, to be surrounded by passionate people discussing big, messy, complicated ethical questions. I don’t find it overwhelming; in fact, it fuels me. I’d naturally drift toward small groups already deep in conversation, eager to listen, jump in, challenge ideas, and let my own views be challenged. For me, these spaces are less about formality and more about creative collision and emotional electricity. They make me feel alive."

I'd rather blend into the background, maybe stand by the snack table or look at the artwork, hoping someone notices me. It's not that I dislike people—I actually find their stories and expressions fascinating—but starting the interaction feels... like swimming upstream. It takes so much energy, and I always worry I’ll say something awkward or pointless. So, I'd quietly wait, maybe give small smiles if someone glances my way, but I wouldn’t push myself to break the silence first.",
        "Honestly, stepping into a room like that, with all the noise and people buzzing around, makes me feel small and sort of... invisible. I wouldn’t feel energized at all. It’s more like a dimming inside me, like the air gets thick and my thoughts slow down. I might linger near the edges, observing the clusters of people, listening from a distance to their conversations. I’d probably feel overwhelmed by the number of faces, the pressure to have opinions or clever things to say. I wouldn’t leave right away, though. I’d stay, maybe find a quiet corner where I can watch or sketch in a notebook. It’s not that I’m uninterested in the ideas being discussed—those actually excite me in a quiet, personal way—but the social part drains me before I even start."

        "Honestly, if I found out my elderly parent had been taking money from my wallet, my first emotion would probably be a mix of surprise and sadness more than anger. Given their age, I would naturally consider that maybe they felt ashamed to ask, or perhaps it's a sign of forgetfulness or some deeper need they aren’t expressing. I think I would forgive them quite quickly. They’re family, and at this stage in life, I’d rather focus on understanding than conflict. I would try to gently bring it up with warmth, making it clear I love and respect them, and perhaps set up a more open way for them to ask for what they need—maybe a shared envelope for petty cash or something that allows them dignity. The relationship means more to me than the money or the mistake.",
        "In the situation with the colleague, I think my initial instinct would be to feel a bit guarded. I value collaboration and love helping people, but if someone starts presenting my ideas as theirs, it would sting. I’d probably start wondering about their intentions, and my trust would naturally dip. However, I’d also recognize that workplaces can be messy, and maybe they’re just inexperienced in giving credit. I’d be open to giving them the benefit of the doubt once, but I would also make sure to set subtle boundaries—like documenting help I give or gently bringing up the issue if it happens again. I wouldn’t want to jump straight to assuming bad faith, but I also wouldn’t ignore patterns that make me feel taken advantage of. Trust is important to me, but so is self-respect."

I’d feel betrayed, and that kind of breach of trust would stick with me. I wouldn’t start a fight for the sake of keeping the peace in the house, but I’d definitely set hard boundaries—maybe lock my stuff up, keep my money where they can’t reach it. I’d also make it clear that I see them differently now. I don’t believe in pretending everything’s fine just to avoid discomfort. They crossed a line, and that doesn’t just get erased because they admitted it.",
        "I’d distrust them immediately. I see people like that as opportunists—they pretend to ask for help, but they’re just scavenging for easy shortcuts and trying to shine in front of others using your work. I wouldn’t buy into their act of “team spirit” for a second. I’d probably keep my answers vague or mislead them a bit to see how far they’re willing to go. I don’t feel any obligation to be generous with people who can’t be trusted to give credit where it’s due. I don’t believe most people have good intentions by default—you have to prove yourself. And if I sense someone’s the type to leech off others, I cut them off fast."
